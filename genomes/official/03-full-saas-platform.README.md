## Technology Stack

**Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Actions)

---

## Architectural Pattern

**Multi-Pattern Architecture** (showcases all three):

### Pattern A: Connector + Feature (Complex)
**Payments Organization Billing**:
- Connector: `stripe/nextjs-drizzle` (API routes with Stripe + Drizzle)
- Feature: `payments/backend` (TanStack Query hooks)
- Use: Complex multi-tech integration

### Pattern B: Feature-Only (Simple)
**Email System**:
- No connector needed
- Feature generates own API routes
- Use: Simple SDK integration (Resend)

### Pattern C: SDK-Driven (Abstracted)
**Authentication**:
- Better Auth SDK generates all routes
- Feature wraps with hooks
- Use: SDK handles complexity

**This genome demonstrates all three patterns in production.**

---

## What You Get

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Organization Structure**:
```
Organization (Company)
  ├── Users (employees)
  ├── Teams (departments/projects)
  │   ├── Members
  │   └── Permissions
  ├── Subscription (billing)
  │   ├── Seats (per-user)
  │   └── Usage (metered features)
  └── Settings
```

**Data Isolation**:
- Row-level security (via Drizzle)
- Organization ID on every table
- Team-based permissions

**Billing Model**:
- Base subscription (per organization)
- Seat charges (per active user)
- Usage charges (API calls, storage, etc.)
